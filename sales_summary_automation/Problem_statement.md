## Project Problem Statement: Sales Summary Automation

This project addresses a business need at a second-hand car dealership that wants to improve how it shares monthly sales performance with stakeholders.

Currently, sales data is available via a web service at the end of each month. However, management has requested that this data be delivered in a **more readable and accessible format**, specifically as a **PDF summary** sent via **email**.

To meet this need, the project automates the following tasks:

- **Retrieving** monthly sales data from an existing web service
- **Processing** and summarizing the data into key categories (e.g., total sales, car types, revenue) 
- **Generating** a well-formatted PDF report using Python 
- **Emailing** the PDF to management automatically

This solution is a practical example of how Python can be used to automate reporting workflows, streamline business communications, and reduce manual effort in routine data-sharing processes.
